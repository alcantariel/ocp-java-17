- Utilizing Java Object-Oriented Approach
  - Create classes and records
  - Define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors, and instance and static initializers
  - Understand variable scopes, use local variable type inference, apply encapsulation, and make object immutable
  - Implement polymorphism and differentiate object type versus reference type. Perform type casting, identify object types using instanceof operator and pattern matching
